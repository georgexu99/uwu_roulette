This extension inserts a 1/6 (just like a revolver) to blow your chrome up with uwu imagery and text!

To install this extension:

navigate to chrome://extensions, make sure that the Developer mode switch is turned on in the upper right, and click Load Unpacked. Then select the appropriate directory (the dist directory containing manifest.json);

If it worked you should see an icon for the uwu_roulette Chrome extension.

Removing the extension:

To remove the extension, click Remove on the extension page, or use the Remove from Chrome... menu option when right clicking the icon.
